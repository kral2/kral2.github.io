Hello,

This is the first post on my personal blog, at least in his new formula.

First things first, those of you who was following me before (a very tiny circle of close friends) noticed I'm publishing in English : I will try to do that at least for all technical stuff, as it will be easier this way than using hilarious translations ... Bear with my english, I'm more used to read itÂ than to write it :)

For other personal hobbies, or when I am not in the mood, I still keep the option to freely switch in one of my native tongues :)

<strong>So, why vKral?</strong>
Because like everyone, there is "many me" : we are all playing a different role along the day, based on time and context.

Relativity is still king in 2k ...

Instead of creating separate blog for each <del>addiction</del> area of interest, I decided to consolidate all of them into one blog, all running in his own context : you can call it blog virtualization ;)

<strong>What to expect?</strong>
I aim to primarily write about technical stuff, specially virtualization and the adjacent.
Time to time, I may be writing about my personal hobbies, under their own categories.
