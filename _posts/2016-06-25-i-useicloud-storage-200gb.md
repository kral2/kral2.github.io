Today I decided once again to stop fighting against apple's devil plan to rule my wallet : I subscribed to an iCloud 200 GB storage plan.

I already have plenty of "databox", either personal/free or corporate accounts, with free space. And to be honest, Apple's databox is not the best one, nor the cheapest too. Yet I did the maths and came to the conclusion that <u>for my particular use case</u>, it's a good enough solution with a fair price.

It's a major mind shift for me : I always considered cloud databoxes overpriced.

My use case is pretty simple : I want to backup my iPhone, which hold up to 128 GB of data. Here is my context :
<ul>
	<li>My main computer is a MacBook Air,</li>
	<li>256 GB SSD, I value every single GB of it worthy to be traded on the comex market,</li>
	<li>Anyway, my phone is plugged on the Mac approximately every ~never,</li>
	<li>My central "home Mac mini" holding the "global" iTunes DB is left for dead for years now : so yesterday solution design,</li>
	<li>I don't want to feel the pain of managing (and carrying) USB drives &amp; creating symlinks on my airbook to divert iPhone's backup to it anymore : I value my time too much for that.</li>
</ul>
So I decided to be a nice cloud consumer, and delegate the hassle of running/maintaining the storage infrastructure : there is zero value doing it myself (geeky time is too precious to manage a backup nas@home).

Apple charge me 2.99€/month for 200 GB : that's 35,88€/year.

200 GB is enough to hold all the data of my <i>oneday-potentially</i> full iphone (which is not atm), and leave me plenty of room for files on iCloud Drive and other "maybe one day" interesting services (iCloud photo library).

For the security &amp; personal information aspect, I am willing to trust the cryptographic science (call me foolish).

A 200GB HDD is around 25€ on Amazon, so iCloud storage subscription is ~30% more expensive than a naked disk.

I consider this premium, as the price of peace of mind :
<ul>
	<li>No need to provision space on the home nas,</li>
	<li>Don't need to run that disk 24/7 and care about HDD failure,</li>
	<li>Nothing to do when I come home : it's just backed up, no matter where I was the whole day/week.</li>
</ul>
Okay, an HDD you own is a onetime purchase, while Apple's service is a subscription : I pay the HDD again every year.

So basically, it could be like I throw my 200GB HDD through the window each year and buy a new one : it make no economical or ecological sense.

But in fact it's a greener option! The cloud storage have already been bought by someone else anyway : I am just using it. That drive space is absolutely more efficient than the one in my nas sitting on the living room : deduped/compressed for sure.

And finally, I can cancel my subscription anytime if I am considering that I can go without that iphone backup for a period.

That's agility baby!
