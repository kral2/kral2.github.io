Here is a quick memo of some CLI commands I use. Just a quick reminder for the few commands I may need on my daily operations.

Today's task is just creating a vlan on a Brocade network switchs, running NOS (Network OS).
<pre><code>conf t
interface vlan &lt;vlan id&gt;
description &lt;your vlan description&gt;

end</code></pre>
<blockquote>Update : 2015-06
Yes, you silly Cisco-Admin, you read it right : @Brocade NOS, with this command you don't create an SVI, but just a vlan :-)</blockquote>
A quick extract from the Admin Guide:

<em>On Brocade VDX hardware, VLANs are treated as interfaces from a configuration point of view. By default all the DCB ports are assigned to VLAN 1 (VLAN ID equals 1).</em>

<em>The vlan_ID value can be 1 through 3963. VLAN IDs 3964 through 4090 are internally-reserved VLAN IDs.</em>
<em>However, the reserved-vlan command can modify this range. VLANs above 4090 are not configurable. Refer to the Network OS Command Reference.</em>

Here are some links to deep dive in Brocade Network OS, as usual you have to <em>RTFM</em> to become a master:

There is some other basic command I may cover later like VCS, port-channels, etc ...
